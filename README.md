# SMBUD Project A.A. 2024-2025
This project was part of the 2024/2025 edition of the course Systems and Methods for Big and Unstructured Data (SMBUD), held at Politecnico di Milano. \
This repository contains all the files relevant to the project, including code, results of the queries and the final report. \

## The project
The project, in its version for 1 student, consisted of choosing a publicly available dataset of at least 20000 punctual data, loading it into one of the main technologies seen during the course (Neo4j, MongoDB, ElasticSearch) and performing 10 relevant queries on the dataset. It was also possible to submit some analysis on the queries done in the project as additional work.

This project uses the [Logainm.ie](https://www.logainm.ie/en/) dataset, on the topic of Irish toponymy, while the technology of choice was MongoDB. Additional work was provided using Python (the pymongo library in particular).

## The repository
The repository is organized as follows:
 - Files: the files of the project
   - Analysis: the Python scripts and the results of the analysis conducted on 3 of the 10 queries
   - Queries: the text of the queries run in MongoDB
   - Results: the complete results of the queries in JSON format
 - README.md: this file
 - SMBUD Project - Francesco Galbiati.pdf: the complete report of the project
